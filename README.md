# Object Recognition Based On Super Pixel Method

Computer vision applications commonly using data
sets for training object recognition systems, sets that include
images which are tightly cropped around objects. This approach
decreases the running time and increase recognition accuracy by
providing best characteristics of the objects of interests to the
learning algorithms. In an effort to create best test set for
learning algorithms, we decided to use superpixel grouping based
object recognition. Resulting objects can be used for training the
learning algorithms. While this approach can be efficient for
complex recognition algorithms which will focus only proposed
objects from our algorithm rather than calculating the objects by
itself, it can also be powerful and efficient for other but rather
simple computer vision applications as well.
